# Sequence Predictor

## To check

    - Small-to-Medium Data:
        Use TCNs or hybrid models (CNN + LSTM).
    - Large Data:
        Transformers are ideal due to scalability and performance.
    - If Sequence Dependencies are Weak:
        Pure CNN models like ResNet, EfficientNet, or MobileNet (better than GoogLeNet for general tasks).

## Installation

### For Predictor (Python)
To install, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras
- art
- keras-tcn

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

Using the requirements file:

```
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For CPU only: 
```
    python3 -m pip install numpy tensorflow keras art pandas scikit-learn matplotlib keras-tcn
```

For GPU enabled:

```
    python3 -m pip install numpy tensorflow[and-cuda] keras art pandas scikit-learn matplotlib keras-tcn
```

### For server (NodeJs)

Run in root of folder (where the package.json is located):

```
    npm i
```

If pm2 is needed also run:

```
    npm i pm2 -g
```
## How to run prediction

To run the complete flow run:

```
    python3 Predictor.py
```

To test model specific for example LSTM run:

```
    python3 LSTM.py
```

Check the __main__ section of the LSTM.py or GRU.py for pointing to data and set parameters for testing.

## Run server

The server is a NodeJS server with a plain simple html server side rendered front-end. No dependencies or heavy webpacks needed.
The server will listen on 0.0.0.0 and port 30001. This can be changed in the config.js file.

To run the server use the command:

```
    npm start
```

Pm2 can also be used. For this run:

```
    pm2 start server.js --name predictor --time --watch 
```

Then for saving this in the pm2 run list (needed for auto start):

```
    pm2 save
```

For having it with auto start at boot:

```
    pm2 startup
```

## Testing

To test a model when modifying or tuning you can run the LSTM.py or GRU.py directly and check the __main__ section. Use the test folder for trainingData and models if you don't want to touch the actual data (highly recommended). 

For testing You, in the `test` folder, can manually remove the last result from the .csv files and put it in the `sequenceToPredict_xxx.json` file. Then when tuning or changing the model, the results are compared. **It is of importance to take the latest result out of the test data**.
